Hello! And welcome to Intro to SQL programming.

In this course, we are going to use the standards-based SQL language

We will use a particular database product called MySQL, which is an open-source relational database management system

We also will use MySQL Workbench - a visual database design tool that would help us to perform tasks when working with databases

## What is data / big data?

We store data in databases, but we can access it, manipulate it and play with it by using something like SQL.


## What is a database?

Container that holds data

Data in the DB container is organised in a particular way

Data is held in tables (each table has columns and rows, similar to a spreadsheet). One database holds many tables

Data can be efficiently stored and retrieved from DB

We want to put data in a DB in such way that it makes the one and only source of truth

We want data to be accessible and we want it to be easy to ‘query’, i.e. ask the DB questions about our data

We want to add new data and delete old, unused one, so we want to manage and maintain our data efficiently

We want to persist data and keep it safe


## Database vs Spreadsheet

Commonality: data stored in table as rows and columns

DB can contain hundreds of tables and all those tables can be related to one another

DB can hold data for the whole line of business, e.g. HR, Finance, Sales

We can easily retrieve data from a DB, including data from multiple tables combined at the same time. We can also update and insert data more efficiently

## Summary
Databases are one of the most important parts of the tech world. It is widely used in programming, software development, application development and many other areas

We use SQL language to communicate with Databases, specifically, we ask DB questions to retrieve data

Relational Database holds many tables that have connections to each other, i.e. tables are related to one another in a certain way

Data is stored in tables. Each table has columns, rows, cells and restrictions applied to them

There are many different types of data that can be stored in table columns. There are also NULL values, which mean that ‘in theory data exist, but it is not available in the DB’
