## Creating our first database

Not part of the official SQL Standard, but the command that we will use to set up the database is:

```sqlC
CREATE DATABASE database_name
```

You will be able to use this with most implementations, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite.

To use the DB we will have to scope our queries to it:

```sql
USE database_name
```
Then we could use our `SELECT` statement
